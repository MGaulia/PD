### Title 
Social media impact on cryptocurrencies prices


### Abstract
Cryptocurrencies differ from regular financial markets in many aspects, their
prices depend on totally different things than companies’ stock prices. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, not controlled by any financial institutions, their use is
very limited. One of the main things that affects cryptocurrency’s price is its popularity and people’s opinion about it shared on social media. Based on this theory
we are going to explore whether social media posts about XRP cryptocurrency
impact its price
